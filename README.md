# Project-4-CS1-Java
The GitHub file keeps the code for Project 4 in my Computer Science 1 class.
The company code creates the company where the employee works
The employee code creates employees in the company created and fills in the criteria allowing the company class to sort through. 

All test cases were made for the two classes.
