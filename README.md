# Project-4-CS1-Java
The GitHub file keeps the code for Project 4 in my Computer Science 1 class.
The company code creates the company and uses the employee class for numerous other methods. 
The employee code creates employees and sorts them based on the method. 

All test cases were made for the two classes.
